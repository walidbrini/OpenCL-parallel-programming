# OpenCL Parallel Programming Projects

Welcome to the **OpenCL Parallel Programming** repository! This repository contains academic projects and training materials focused on exploring and mastering the concepts of **parallel programming** using **OpenCL**.

## Overview

The projects in this repository are part of academic coursework and practical training on parallel computing with OpenCL. The goal of these projects is to understand and implement **data parallelism**, explore the **programmable graphics pipeline**, and utilize **OpenCL's execution model** for high-performance computing on modern GPUs.

## Contents

1. **Data Parallelism**
   - Introduction to **SIMD** (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)
   - Concepts of data parallelism in OpenCL
  
2. **Programmable Graphics Pipeline**
   - Differences between **CUDA / OpenCL** for general-purpose computation and **DirectX / OpenGL** for graphical operations
   - GPU architecture and how OpenCL harnesses the power of thousands of cores for parallel tasks

3. **OpenCL Workflows**
   - Host and compute device architecture
   - Writing and executing OpenCL kernels
   - Execution model and work-item organization in 1D, 2D, and 3D

4. **Execution Model**
   - Understanding **global size** and **local IDs** in OpenCL
   - Synchronizing execution and managing command queues

## Projects and Training Exercises

Each folder within this repository contains project files, code examples, and kernel implementations demonstrating various aspects of OpenCL parallel programming. The projects are designed to build foundational knowledge and provide hands-on experience with:

- Kernel development
- Memory management in parallel systems
- Optimization techniques for parallel performance
